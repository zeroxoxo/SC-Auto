The sole purpose of this script is to automate soundcloud promotion, without penalties for using bots.
Here's how it works:
1. Pick popular user with similar music style of yours.
2. Put his id into "reference_user_id" variable.
3. Find out (idk how, but do it anyway) access_token of your account in any working app that uses soundcloud API.
4. Put it as string to "token" variable.
5. Use script once a day.

What's the script does:
Follow users followed to reference user and unfollow users that didn't followed you in some time after you followed them.
Users unfollowed by script won't be followed by script again to get rid of cycles of following/unfollowing the same user.
Users you follow also get like and positive comment on last posted audio, to get their attention to your profile.

This method isn't the fastest method, but it faster than waiting for random users to find your profile and hope that some of them would follow you on their own.

I've got around 1000 followers in a year using this method, even though the music i make isn't of popular genre at all.
